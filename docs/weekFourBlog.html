          <h2 class="section-heading">Updates on Code</h2>

          <p> Currently the GitHub is only has the website code. We have a glitch project
            that was shared to everyone on the team. Currently the main glitch project
            has code from our rapid prototype. To simulate branches and testing, everyone
            has their own glitch project to manipulate before adding on to the main
            glitch project.
          </p>

          <p> Orginally, we planned on using our laptop's GPU to process the pose estimation.
            However, Peter found out that our results gave us frames that were 15fps which
            was not ideal for when we do retargetting in the future. So we decided to a get
            access to a lab machine to get better results when we run our GPU </p>

          <p>Yan has been looking into a few different libraries to help him get the physics components done. Here are a
            few resources...
          <ul>
            <li>
              <a href="https://medium.com/samsung-internet-dev/making-an-ar-game-with-aframe-529e03ae90cb"
                target="_blank">Link #1</a>
              <p>Allows us to set things as static (unaffected by gravity and collisions) and dynamic bodies (affected
                by gravity and collisions). And also set the physics for the whole environment to stimulate real world
                gravity. Also allows us to get collision contact points. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <a href="
                    https://github.com/ngokevin/aframe-physics-components" target="_blank">Link #2</a>
              <p>Allows for more collision-specific details like the start and end contact points. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <a href="https://github.com/wmurphyrd/aframe-physics-extras" target="_blank">Link #3</a>
              <p>Allow setting collision forces to false, which is something we can do for the basketball hoop itself to
                make sure it does not move upon contact with the ball cause ideally it should be stable. </p>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Updates on Ideas</h2>

          <p> Last week Jasmine finished the <a
              href="https://www.figma.com/file/7XLSPEFDRDzaxYFFzJ6UHT/AR-MockUp?node-id=0%3A1" target="_blank">Figma</a>
            design and incorperated
            feedback from her groupmates earlier this week. Currently she is trying to reproduce all the models and get
            the magic leap
            controllers to work on glitch. Checkout a few pictures of the design or click the link to get a full view of
            Figma design</p>

            <span class="caption text-muted">The main menu screen</span>
          </p>

            </a>
            <span class="caption text-muted">The main gameplay</span>
          </p>

          <p> In addition to designing, Jasmine has been trying to get the gameplay mechanics to work. She has googled
            some WebXR tutorials to gain inspiration and ideas for
            what she can pull into her team's project. She found this <a
              href="https://medium.com/samsung-internet-dev/making-an-ar-game-with-aframe-529e03ae90cb"
              target="_blank">Medium Article by Ada Rose Cannon</a>.
            She tried integrating what was done in the article with Magic Leap components as a starting point but she is
            still trying to figure out how to make the controller responsive. </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Plan for Next Week</h2>

          <p>Here are a couple of milestones that everyone plans on doing</p>

          <p> Jasmine: Getting the controller working so that user can shoot basketballs
            feedback text and if time add audio feedback feature
          </p>
          <p> Peter:
          <ul>
            <li>Pose estimator</li>
            <li> Setup python web server </li>
            <li> Basic feedback working </li>
          </ul>
          </p>
          <p>Yan: Work with Jasmine and CJ to get the controller to work and incorporate the ball trajectory and
            rebounding function </p>
          <p>CJ: Get hoop model imported and get shots in bucket</p>

          <hr>


          <h2 class="section-heading">Blocking Issues</h2>

          <p> Currently Jasmine is having a hard time getting started and making the gameplay mechanics the lack of
            resources to help her develop an AR game in WebXR.
            She has found many resources to build AR games in Unity and AR games that are supported for Andriod
            applications.
            Ultimately, she is having trouble ramping up on JavaScript and HTML/CSS skills and getting the Magic Leap
            Controller to be responsive. </p>

          <p>Yan is facing an issue where the physics library is not comprehensive/ lack of documentation.
            One thing that we wish to do is show the trajectory of the ball but the physics library we intend to use
            does not support that idea, so we need to find a work around.
          </p>
