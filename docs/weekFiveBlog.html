          <h2 class="section-heading">Updates on Code</h2>

          <p> As of April 29th, 2021, BallARs will now be combining all individual projects
            into one project. Up until now, everyone has been working on their own project that
            has been hosted locally on their own computer or glitch. As a result, we did not have
            the best developer enviroment for the past 5 weeks! Take a look at how many glitch
            projects were remixed to test various controls.
          </p>

            <span class="caption text-muted">Many many glitch projects</span>
          </p>

          <p> Once we intergrated everyone's part to a single project, we will have a better dev
            enviroment and we will be able to host our WebAR project! </p>

            enviroment and we will be able to host our WebAR project! </p>

          <p>This week we had to buckle down as we inch closer to demonstrating our MVP next week.
            We would like to give a shoutout to <a href="https://uwrealitylab.github.io/xrcapstone21sp-team1/"
              target="_blank">CSE VR Capstone Team 1</a> for sharing how they implemented a throwing
            mechanism for their VR dodgeball game. It gave us inspiration how we will determine how
            we throw our virtual basketball.

          </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Updates on Ideas</h2>

          <p> With the MVP due just around the corner, it was crunch time for BallARs. We had
            a great start when brainstorming and designing features for our AR application until
            we had to implement it. This past week, we shifted around responsibilities because we
            overestimated and underestimated how quickly some task can be done. For example, one struggle
            for our team was getting the controllers to trigger an event when we thought it can be done in within a few
            days has expanded to a week. However, we were able to make progress by asking for help and from trial and error! </p>

            <p>Earlier this week, we had the virtual basically stay in one position and with the press of the trigger, the 
              ball was shot forward into the hoop.
            </p>

              <span class="caption text-muted">shooting basketball at a static location</span>
            </p>

            <p>Now the user can move the ball around and shoot from various locations of their room. However,
              the ball will only move straight for now. Yan and Jasmine has an idea of how to calculate the 
              velocity and angle the ball which will be crucial to give the trajectory of the ball a realistic
              feel of shooting.

            <p> With the shooting mechanism almost what we envisioned for our MVP, we needed the feedback to incorperate
              in our AR application. Check out a simple feedback interface that CJ works on browser.

          <h2 class="section-heading">Blocking Issues</h2>

          <p>Jasmine and Yan are still trying to figure out how to use a combination of the ball and controller
            position in separate timeframes in order to figure out the angle and velocity of the user's shot
          </p>

          <p> In the future, we hope that the user can the Raycaster for positioning the virtual hoop.
            One blocking issue that Jasmine stumbled upon was the raycaster's showline disappears after a
            few seconds. She's hasn't had time to explore why the line disappears but hypothesizes that
            the she needs to implement a method that refreshes the showline.
