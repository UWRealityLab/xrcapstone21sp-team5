          <h2 class="section-heading">Updates on Code</h2>

          <p> CJ has spent time working on the overlay for BallARs. The reason we added an overlay, so that user
            can recieve information on how the game works before entering AR world. We opted for this option because
            our previous menu overlay had little functionality and wasn't necessary to add another button press. We also
            thought that adding a an extra window for the instructions in AR world would obstruct the user's ability to 
            shoot a ball anywhere, so we decided for our current design. 
          </p>

            <span class="caption text-muted">Overlay with instructions</span>
          </p>

          <p> Peter has been working furiously trying to understand 
            <a href="https://github.com/mkocabas/VIBE"
            target="_blank">VIBE algorithm</a> and implmenting it. He got a simple video clip to work of 
            Steph Curry shooting a free throw basket. He has also gone to Luyang's office hours to get
            help on this algorithm and understand how SMPL body model files work.

            <span class="caption text-muted">Overlay with instructions</span>
          </p>

          <p> Jasmine and Yan has been working on shooting and now the shoot mechanism are less buggy. They took the 
          average of the last 20 frames to get a velocity in the x, y, and z direction. Though the shooting isn't a real
          semblance to real life shooting, it's the closest they can get to simulating throwing a basketball in VR.

          <h2 class="section-heading">Updates on Ideas</h2>

          <p> BallARs has reached the point in the quarter where CSE 481V has become less busy. As a result, they can 
            focus more on their time on coding BallARs. We have about 1.5 more weeks to go, and everything seems to be
            going on track. We are cautiously optimistic that we can achieve our target product.

          <p> With things seemingly on-track, BallARs are still tyring to improve the AR experience

            <li> Work with Jasmine to get a better move hoop mechanism</li>
            <li> start working on croquet</li>
          </ul>
          </p>



          <h4>Jasmine Woon: </h4>

          <p> Goals for Monday 5/24

            <li> Work with Yan to get a better move hoop mechanism</li>
            <li> start working on croquet</li>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Blocking Issues</h2>
          <p> One blocking issue that Jasmine and Yan are facing is how to update the position of the hoop real time. 
            Currently, they have a tick function that checks the controller's old position and current position. Then,
            using those two positions, calculate the change for the new hoop's position. However, they are encountering 
            a behavior where the controller's old position and current position are the same each tick. They need a way
            to get two different position in order to work. See their attempt <a href="https://glitch.com/edit/#!/rebel-brass-fuschia?path=moveHoop.js%3A1%3A0"
            target="_blank">here</a>.
          </p>
          <p> CJ is trying to figure out how to handle the case when the user throws an air ball. He hasn't come up with a
            solution just yet but he's working on it!
