# BallArs 

BallARs is an augmented reality application that allows users to practice their basketball shooting skills by having the opportunity to shoot a virtual basketball into a virtual hoop and gain feedback from in-game physics and pose estimation. What makes our app unique is we will have a retargeted model to showcase how the user shot and compare their shot to an NBA player.

Devices used for this project are Magic Leap 1
